# DesignGameOptimisations
This is an optimised version of a C++, raylib game featuring an octopus destroyer and critters, originally provided as an unoptimised project. I implemented an object pool for efficient critter management and a hash table as a resource manager for improved performance and resource handling, adhering to design and performance requirements.
